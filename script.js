// To begin, solve the following classic “Fizz Buzz” problem. There are a few different ways to do this - experiment with what you think is the most efficient. Once you have solved the problem, ask yourself if there could be another way; and if so, would it be better.
// Accomplish the following:
// Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100.
// If a number is divisible by 3, log “Fizz.”
// If a number is divisible by 5, log “Buzz.”
// If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log “Fizz Buzz.”
// If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, log the number.
// Remember to commit your solution once it is working.

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
    console.log(`Fizz Buzz.`);
  } else if (i % 3 !== 0 && i % 5 !== 0) {
    console.log(`${i}`);
  } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
    console.log(`Fizz`);
  } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
    console.log(`Buzz`);
  }
}
